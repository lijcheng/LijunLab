## AREA OF EXPERTISE

### Artificial intelligence in drug discovery and development
- The aim of “precision medicine” is to devise individualized treatment strategies and therapies. Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods play important roles in predicting the efficacy of drugs from clinical study data, based on patient characteristics. Dr. Cheng focuses on AI mathematical methods development that efficiently identify the characteristics relevant to molecular mechanisms of drug resistance, disease progression and an optimal drug recommendation in the disease treatment. Dr.Cheng's work has substantially advanced our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, and other disorders by using AI technology and strategy. With respect to cancer specifically, her research adapts patient genomic feature data to study molecularly characterized tumors as an alternative to traditional histologic identification. The novel AI computational technology will enable to improve drug selection and courses of treatment for different types of cancer patients depending on their specific genetic and genomics variations.

### Molecular mechanisms of drug resistance, and efficacy therapeutics to overcome  
- Dr.Cheng developed a series of resources and methods to facilitate data mining of drug resistance mechanism and new drug combination from various data sources. 
- Dr. Cheng’s pioneering work led to 52 publications in renowned journals, such as Nature genetics(Impact factor:26.7), Advanced Science	(Impact factor:16.8, Co-first authors), Molecular Cancer (Impact factor:	25.55), Cancer Research(Impact factor:	12.8, Co-first authors), Oncogene (Impact factor, 8.6), Clinical Pharmacology Therapy (Impact factor,	6.544, Co-first), Cancers (Impact factor,	6.16, co-first author), Journal of Clinical Immunology( Impact factor:6.780), Journal of biological chemistry (Impact factor:	4.238	), The Prostate	(Impact factor:4.47) (Biology, Impact factor: 3.796) as well as professional conferences, such as AMIA Summits on Translational Science Proceedings.

#### [XDeath shinyapps cloud](https://pcm2019.shinyapps.io/LijunLab_Pathway_Enrichment/) for therapeutic target identification to induce property cell death in cancer.
- XDeath is to identify the most significant therapeutic targets to induce cell death regulately. At the same time, the XDeath model is for the mechanism interpreting of disease progression and drug resistance.
- Using a deep neural network model, XDeath, is used to precisely identify therapeutic targets that are associated with cancer initiation and/or progression. The unique method could detect molecular targeting of distinct deregulated active signaling elements that might contribute to their sustained growth, survival, and treatment resistance, therefore, is of immense therapeutic interest. These novel target identification approaches should improve the efficacy of current therapeutic treatments against highly aggressive, metastatic, recurrent, and lethal cancers. Twenty-nine pathways of cell death with eight cell death modes, apoptosis, autophagy, autosis, immunogenic (T cell, B cell), necroptosis, the broad-spectrum protein kinase C (PKC) ferroptosis, and proliferation (survival) are observed systematically. Molecular mechanisms of crosstalk during cancer progresses dynamically from the early stage to the advanced stage and is investigated in two independent datasets. Current platform, as prostate cancer for example, we demonstrated how these survival pathways crosstalk switches and caused prostate cancer progression. The optimal therapeutic targets are identified to stop progression, where TCGA: 550 patients for modelling construction, and GEO serial ID GSE21032: 177 patients for validation.

#### [Bi-EB](https://github.com/lijcheng12/Bi-EB) package --- biclustering method based on empirical bayesian
- Bi-EB tool detects the patterns shared from both integrated omics data and between species [1].
- A fast empirical Bayesian biclustering (Bi-EB) algorithm is developed to detect the patterns shared from both integrated omics data and between species.
- The genome molecular features shared between cell lines and tumors give us insight into discovering potential drug targets for cancer patients. 
- Our previous studies demonstrate that these important drug targets in breast cancer, ESR1, PGR, HER2, EGFR, and AR have a high similarity in mRNA and protein variation in both tumors and cell lines [2-3]. 
- Based on the evidence, we developed a biclustering method based on empirical bayesian (Bi-EB), to detect the local pattern of integrated omics data both in cancer cells and tumors. We adopt a data driven statistics strategy by using Expected-Maximum (EM) algorithm to extract the foreground bicluster pattern from its background noise data in an iterative search. Our novel Bi-EB statistical model has better chance to detect co-current patterns of gene and protein expression variation than the existing biclustering algorithms and seek the drug targets’ co-regulated modules of mRNA and protein.

#### 3. Drug repurpose: optimal therapeutic targets identification 
**Dr.Cheng has developed several system biology optimization methods for therapeutic targets identification and associated effective drug recommendation for cancer. Systematic network analysis on cancer patients has multiple potential biological and clinical applications. A better understanding of the effects of gene/protein interaction may lead to the identification of cancer genes and correlated pathways, which, in turn, may offer better targets for drug development in cancer treatment. An optimizing subnetwork searching of drug targets algorithms is developed for drug targets selection, such as IODNE for triple negative breast cancer and SCNrank for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
